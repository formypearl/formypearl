            <div class="col-md-12">

                <p>I had this dream on 18th January 2018... It was about a week after you were first fired and then re-hired by Chianna after a misunderstanding that occured between the three of us... This is one of my best dreams and certainly the wildest of them all with much detailing... Im happy that I could remember much of it and scribbled it out then... I still remember it clearly right now as I write it because I love this dream so much and the characters in this are the 2 best girls of my life... So this is how it goes...</p>
                <p>It starts on the bedroom of my house, the same one that I sleep now... My phone rings early in the morning as it woke me up from my sleep, which i just resumed after the regular texting with Chianna, as she wakes up in Hawaii... Half awake, I notice it was an unknown number and attend the call, and my eyes widened as i heard Margo on the other end of the call... She said she was in town and asked me to pick her up... So i got ready and went to her... This was totally unexpected... I could easily recognise her from far in the midst of a number of my fellow countrymen, and she had many eyes on her now and then... Short, cute and sexy, she looked comfortable and confident for a girl of her age even when she had many eyes on her... And i smiled to myself as i was outrightly happy to see her... </p>
                <p>She only recognised me when i got close to her... She looked serious but gave me a curt smile to me with a formal hug... I drove her into one of the hotels and made her settle in... We had a pleasant chat and she said she was just visiting me as she had to come to India as part of her work... I bought her chocolates and flowers as she freshened herself up... We went out to eat and had a nice meal in one of the popular hotels... She seemed to be quiet the whole time but I could easily notice that she clearly liked the food... </p>
                <p>She said she had one day to spend before she went back... We were about to go sightseeing but then it started to rain... So I told her we could go watch a Hollywood flick that was running on the nearby cinemas later that day... She was awkwardly reluctant about it but nodded her head... I asked her if she was okay and she said yes... So she got ready and we got in... There wasnt much people in for the movie and we got seated somewhere vacant... The movie started playing and soon I could see that she was mildly sweating even with the air conditioner on inside the theatre... And she looked uncomfortable... I asked her what was the matter but she didnt seem to hear and was murmuring words to herself with clenched fists placed on her thighs...  I was wondering what happened and suddenly she reached to her bag, and pulled out a live snake and threw it to the front of the screen...</p>
                <p>I was simply shocked and unmoved for a second... People didnt know how it got there but they noticed the snake and began to panic and exit the room... Meanwhile, She stood up and walked off swiftly as if nothing happened, without any emotion... I followed... As the staff and security were busy capturing the snake, we all hurried off without much fuss and attention... And as we got out, I held her hand to stop her... And asked, "why did you do that?" She kept talking to herself, and i could make out the words, 'emergency protocol' from those murmurs... I held her body and shook her up all at once... and i saw it... </p>
                <p>A small bud with a tiny antenna attached to her earrings, and her necklace... I could easily make out what it was... And i told her, "You maybe smart, but i am smarter..." And pulled the microphone and earpiece off her ornaments... Still i could see she was with less emotion of everything that was happening... I sat her down on the bench of the mall we were in... And grabbed her phone... I could make out the devices were transmitting to Hawaii... And i knew what was happening... And so I called Chianna from her phone... </p>
                <p>And I was angry... I asked, "what are you trying to do honey?" She didnt expect that, but she was cool with her response, with a cheeky laugh that i loved about her, she said, "I was just testing you babe..." I asked her what had she done to margo... She said she was sedated and wired so as to work out the instructions effectively without less emotions and feelings... I asked her how to unsedate her and wake her fully, she said "hot water followed by cold water on both her wrists at the same time and rub for a few seconds"... I told Chianna that I will fly with Margo to visit her, and she said she was about to ask the same... And she sounded so happy of meeting me... </p>
                <p>And i disconnected the call... So i now understood... Margo was instructed and sedated by her just as a test for me to see if i get more into her as we go out to places and be together for the while... And it was spoiled by the rain at first, and the electronic waves inside the cinemas, with air conditioning, that may have suffocated her as she was sedated and wired, which made her follow the emergency protocol, with the snake... </p>
                <p>The rain was off... And margo seemed to be dizzy and with less emotions of all that happened a while ago... So i supported her, got her up and took her to the nearest coffee shop, where i asked for a cup of hot and cold water... I held her wrists together and poured hot water followed by cold water on them and rubbed them for a while... And it worked like a charm as i saw her eyes widen and she retrieved her hands from mine and shaked off the water... She was awake... </p>
                <p>I smiled at her... She looked speechless for a second and collapsed onto her cushion... And she was slowly realising what just happened... And then she smiled at me and said "Hi, Im so sorry about all this... Miss C wanted to check... Im sorry that happened this way..." She sounded quite cheerful on contrast to her serious and emotionless self until a while ago... And i was surprised that she was not even upset that she was sedated and used for just a casual checking... I wondered if this would have after effects on her health... </p>
                <p>I asked, "are you okay?" She said "yes im completely fine" and we walked off... We went to a park and talked for a while... I really liked how cheerful she was all the while... She seemed to be happy meeting me... And she was all words about many things and time flew past unnoticed as we continued talking for long... I dropped her on the hotel and said that I will pack and come back the next day, and wished her good night as i went back home... </p>
                <p>I couldnt sleep much that night... I felt bad for Margo of what she was put up to do... And i really admired her for taking all this with a smile and being cheered up all the while when she was with me... I wondered if she was the same with everyone else... </p>
                <p>I packed my things and went to the hotel the next morning and she was ready to vacate and we left together to the airport... We got seated adjacently on the flight and we continued our chat from where we left off last night in the park... We talked about many things... </p>
                <p>I told her about how I met Chianna and how easily we fell in love with each other and how that changed and turned around each others lives for good from the day one... I told her how much we love, believe, trust and have faith in each other even though we havent been together yet... These are hard times and maybe that made her mind complicated as she has had many bad experiences before in life... I told her even though things are as they are now, our love is still strong... I told her how "everything happens for a reason..." </p>
                <p>It was a misunderstanding that led to Margo getting fired before a week... And it was my mistake that made it happen... I told margo how bad I felt about it later and how i asked her to reconsider a lot and lot of times explaining everything that happened until she said yes... I told her that I feel she is safe with Margo by her side... And that I wanted them to continue as the best friends they have been for so long... </p>
                <p>I told her that she is a precious gem for both of us to keep close to... And i told her how amazing a woman she is to do what she does to me and Miss C given her busy schedule and life circumstances, which is both emotionally and physically straining... She did a lot more than what was asked of her by her Miss C, and did it so well... It was only because of her that I didnt lose my mind in all this chaos... And she found time to make me happy and cheer me up time to time talking to me and she could do so effortlessly and i felt really close and touched with what she did to me being that selfless even when her life was going not so great... </p>
                <p>And i told her about that faked voices of hers that were sent to me by Chianna... Especially the one of more than 6 minutes... I told her that it inspired me most and that I kept on listening to it for months everytime i wanted motivation or when i missed Chianna... I told her that it was her voice that said "Show it to me that you can" that motivated me most to do things... I told her how similar both of them are and I was slowly realising that it was nearly a combination of both that I was loving at times... And I just smiled as many thoughts came into me as we were landing on Hawaii... and I smiled at her... And she smiled back... It  seemed that she had been thinking too...  </p>
                <p>As the flight was landing, I got a first glance at the place... I told her how beautiful this place is, and we got out... I think we were supposed to go to Chianna, but Margo said... "Do you have your faith, trust and belief in me?"... I was puzzled, but said, "Yes of course"... So she said "Lets take a detour"... and said, "show it to me that you can"... </p>
                <p>And so we unpacked at her apartment and drove to the shore... She made a call and we jet skiied our way into a nearby island with everything left on the car... She was good at riding it as i held on tight... We went to the side of the island that was completely empty except for the waves hitting the shore... And we got off... And there was a mountain on the island which was high but not so large... And she said... "follow me"... and started climbing the mountain... I gulped and gaped at her as she started climbing with a stick on her hands, wearing tees and shorts, and just casual sandals... I followed her awestruck by how wild she was... </p>
                <p>It was a rocky and steep mountain, but it was gripping and she seemed to know her way to the top as we climbed on... We climbed and climbed, paused and climbed, rested and climbed and finally reached the surface after sometime; where there was a way up through which fresh water was flowing down as a stream and another way which led to another part of the mountain in the direction of the stream... </p>
                <p>There was a big rock that almost halted the whole stream except for a narrow flow on its side... Water was fresh there and it was almost like a big pool near the rock... She removed her clothes except for her swimwear and put it all on the big rock... I did the same and jumped into the pool after her... </p>
                <p>The water was so cold and fresh with very little flow... It was like a natural pool except for a narrow stream going through the sides... So we swam there for a while... 'All the climb was worth it...', i thought... Little did i know that this was just a start... Margo swam to the narrow stream that flowed through the sides... I followed without question... I looked at it when i got there... It was a stream that was running down spirally through the sides of the rock, to the other side... As i looked closer, that was the edge of the mountain too... </p>
                <p>She turned around and gave me a naughty smile... I smiled back and said... "This is so beautiful... Amazing-", she came a bit closer, winked at me, cut me off midway and said in the same tone of the voice that i loved and that made me go crazy for last two months, "show it to me, that you can...", smiled calmly, and turned around... and started swimming down the stream... </p>
                <p>The effect that this voice, especially these words had on me was immense... It felt like adrenaline rush inside me each time i listened to it... It was as if that was the only thing i needed to be my best and do my best... And so without second thought and another word, i smiled widely as an effect of hearing it again live, and swam down behind her without question... </p>
                <p>It was a calm flow that was just around three metres wide and shallow, and i caught up with her, and we laughed and swam down the spiral together, to the other side, smiling at each other as we did... At one point I taunted her simply by saying, "I can go a bit further than that", and overtook her, but she seemed unfazed and said, "ofcourse, we will", smiling... And i slowed down with eyes widened and gaped at her as she lead swimming and I followed, realising how wild she was... </p>
                <p>And spiral went further down with a stronger flow and a bit narrower to the other side... I asked, " still you want more?" She said "yes", and so i followed... And we reached another smaller pool with a stronger flow nearly underneath the big pool of the spiral as we seemed to have completed a circle... And there is a path if we want to get off the stream and climb down the mountain... We slowed down as we reached the pool of water... She asked "do you have faith?"... I said "yes"... She said "follow me... show it to me that you can..." I said "okay", this time a bit serious... So we swam downstream, and the underwater current, the coldness of the water, the dense wild around us and the strength of the flow got stronger after each second... We didnt need to swim anymore... We were being pulled spirally down the water stream..  And the path was getting narrowed... </p>
                <p>And she said " now... do you have faith?" I said "yes..."She said "hands on the chest and lay on the water facing the sky"... I said "but-"... She said, "show it to me that you can"... And she lay on the water hands cross on her chest and body facing sky as the water stream narrowed spirally down with cold water, dense trees and the strongest flow... And i followed her... </p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <img style="width:100%;height:auto" src={{dataSelected.mainData.general.spiral}} />
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-12">

                <p>And then that happened... The curve... The narrowest path, the coldest water, the densest trees, the strongest flow, the best spiral curve... A full spiral just like that... We went whoosing down with the water like a rollercoster ride, with lush green around us, cold water underneath, and blue sky above... And that was the wildest place I have or will ever imagine or see or dream... And so we went... </p>
                <p>The experience... the stream of thoughts that came into my mind during that spiral journey was the best damn thing in my life by far... </p>
                <p>And i smiled...</p>
                <p>No fear...</p>
                <p>No worries...</p>
                <p>Just peace, joy, calm...</p>
                <p>And faith...</p>
                <p>It was serene...</p>
                <p>And we completed the spiral... As we were still flowing down with pace, she said smiling "get up now, and get ready"...</p>
                <p>The dense trees gone, the narrow spiral gone... But the stream flow was still the strongest... And water was still the coldest, in that broad open pool of fresh streaming water... And then i saw where it went... It was leading to a waterfall... The biggest one i have even seen and most certainly with the strongest flow... I was like "whaaaaattt!!!"...But calm... And she said "get a deep breathe and dive in... show it to me that you can... all is well... "</p>
                <p>The highest waterfall i ve ever seen, from the top view of the surface, falling to the sea... A clear separation of fresh falling water and sea water was clear... Clearly visible when looked from the top... An arc of falling fresh water from a cliff covered on all sides with a sea of salt water and we were falling with the water now... And she said "just deep breathe, close your eyes and dive in" and positioned herself to it... </p>
                <p>We were being flushed out of the cliff and the stream with full force and speed and we positioned ourselves mid air when we got out of the stream... For that one moment... We were flying... Mid air... Like birds in the sky... And then we were going down... We saw small dots down there as and realised it was the tourists, many of them down there... That was the highest free fall that I would ever imagine someone will have and I was the one having it with her, wearing nothing else but swimsuits... </p>
                <p>And we went down... And down... And we were reaching the sea surface...I was smiling... I looked at her sideways... She was smiling too... I saw a glimpse of people noticing and moving away... And i closed my eyes, took a deep breath and angled my hands full strecth for a perfect dive... And it was perfect... We went deep deep down like an arrow into the water of the sea and slowly sprang up to the surface... And i realised the most special thing about it... We were not even catching a breath, or gasping or sweating... </p>
                <p>And then i saw her... </p>
                <p>Her smile at that moment was the most satisfying thing I would ever see in my life... And another day, another moment, another scenario, I would have just pulled her close and kissed her deep like I will never kiss ever in my life... </p>
                <p>Even now, part of me hates that I didnt do it... I pulled her and hugged her tight... And asked, "can i kiss you?" She was still smiling wide, and was clear with her answer... and said "yes"... </p>
                <p>I was about to do it... But then I closed my eyes..., refrained and kissed her cheeks... And hugged her so tight for long... </p>
                <p>I looked down for a few seconds... And then I looked at her... And her face was sullen... And I hugged her tight again... </p>
                <p>And I told her...</p>
                <p>"This is the best thing I can imagine someone making me do... And you make me feel it all... It was your voice that made me do things... It was you who is there for me now making me smile, laugh, love, and hope, and do many things the best way, even crazy things, and helping me get up when I feel down, in the toughest times I can ever imagine myself to be in... With my love being engaged to another... With her being unsure and confused at times... And with her being in such bad health already... And me already struggling in my life... I cant imagine myself in a more bad situation in life... And you are dealing with the worst of me, and making me do my best and feel my best whenever you or your thoughts are with me... And you do all these even when you seem to be struggling yourself in your personal life... I really love you margo... And if I get a chance, I will have you as my love and give myself to you...</p>
                <p>But...</p>
                <p>In my life, love is everything for me... And I no longer take anything or anyone for granted ever in my life... And I love her from the day i met her, and she does the same... We both are deeply and strongly in love with each other even when we have never met yet in person... Betrayals, loneliness, being cheated on, and a lot of other bad things that tested us in harsh ways, We both have experienced it all our life... me and Miss C... And we were suffering until we met each other... Thats why we are what we are now... We are still struggling..., but fighting... We have a reason to fight for now... A reason to believe in... Thats why I love her this deep even in these troubling times, even when I have a lot of reasons to leave... I believe in her... I trust her... and I have my faith in her... And thats why I will never leave her until I get a clear outright answer... </p>
                <p>For me, nothing is over until its over, and I will believe and keep fighting until the very end, even if I struggle, wriggle, or get into troubles along the way... </p>
                <p>Thats what I do for love... For what I believe in... And for that I will give my everything for it, be it anything or anyone... </p>
                <p>I really love you margo... And I mean everything i say to you... But for now, I am hers... And thats why I dont want to give myself in now, even though times are hard for me... And I will wait and keep fighting all the struggles by myself until everything clears out... </p>
                <p>I wont distance you by thanking you for everything you do... Because you are close in my heart as one of the two best girls of my life... And I will be there for you under any circumstances as someone you can always count on who will never let you down...</p>
                <p>I love you Margo..."</p>
                <p>And I smiled... she smiled too... </p>
                <p>And we hugged tight for long...</p>
                <p>And went to the shore... </p>
                <p>And jet skiied back to our island...</p>
                <p>And so we went...</p>
                <p>...</p>
                <p>And I woke up...</p>
                <p>And I brushed off the tears from my eyes and smiled... For this was one of the best dreams I will ever have in my life... Most certainly the wildest...</p>
                <p>And you are my pearl... my best dream girl...</p>
