                <p>When I first met and talked to you, I was all sad and worried and broken down and crying sitting in the corner of my room... On Jan 5, 2018, when you first mailed me, you were imitating Chianna... She was in coma and you were doing your job you said... For me it seemed like everything was going down in my already struggling life... My career and now my love too... It felt like I was losing everywhere... That was the worst and the lowest point of my life, when you met me... </p>
                <p>From there, each time you talked to me, every single thing you said to me and did for me and her... You just made me feel it every single time... You know Im smiling wide as I write this... I have no idea how to make this short and to write about you... </p>
                <p>You never told me your name when we met... You just said you are her secretary and you are Cutiepie in discord... So for me, from that time you are my Cutiepie... </p>
                <p>Every single time I think about it, the way we talked to each other, the way we connected, and the way you be there for me in my hardest of times, cheering me up each time, even when you were not having the best days yourself... You just made me feel so loved, so happy and I really, you know, forgot all the sadness and worries... We have the same sort of connection that me and her have... And adding to it, Seeing such selflessness that was so like myself... Giving it all... It just made me fall for you... </p>
                <p>You did way more than what was asked of you by her for me... From talking to me not minding your busy schedule and overburdened work each time understanding only you can help me... Staying late in the hospital and driving there just to make me talk to her... Coming back from New York risking your job... You did a lot and lot of selfless things for me... </p>
                <p>Apart from all this... The way we talked to each other... I really felt closer to you every time... I just felt so warm...I felt love... I was in utter despair and I was struggling badly every day after the incident... and I felt the best every time I talked to you Margo... It was your voice that she sent me I kept listening to for months because that made me feel and do my best...</p>
                <p>You know, I fought with her each time she did not-so-nice things to you... Firing you, invading your privacy, shouting at you, etc... You dont deserve to be treated that way... I kept asking her if you were okay because you were not much contacting me and i knew you were stressed of everything happening... I love you but I couldnt choose you then because even though she was engaged she was still thinking she said... </p>
                <p>You both make me on a great mindset... make me the happiest... and make me do things my best way... and even make me do crazy things... many of em... she made me sing with a guitar for the first time and I did very well for a first timer if you listen to it... Im not Da Vinci or Picasso but you made me paint a proper portrait for the first time outside school... Last time I painted was 12 years ago on my 7th grade... This is one of my better works even though I did it in a hurry... Based on the wild and beautiful dream about us that I had... </p>
                <p>I chose Chianna as my love the day I met her... That is the ONLY reason i am not yours now... I am loyal to the one I love until I know for sure if its a yes or no... I may sound stupid, but thats me. I wont give up on her until I know for sure, even when I know she is engaged and I love you... Its all about who you choose and who chooses you... The timing matters too... Thats why I am saying this... I cant imagine losing the both of you...</p>
                <p>I live for such true love that she and you made me feel... And I value that above everything else in my life... And she couldnt choose me or fight for me, when I truly loved her and she got us into this situation... And now I cant choose you yet because I dont know what she will say or when she will wake up... This is the worst time of my life...</p>
                <p>I can keep on writing of everything that I love about you... Right from that voice of yours that she sent me, which I kept on listening day after day... The crazy things we talked about each time we were spending time with each other... Everytime the way we made each other feel best when I was crying at times and you were crying at times... The selfless love that you have... The way you did things for me even when you knew I had very less chance to be yours... Your sexy voice... That beautiful picture you sent which I could only look for a few seconds... Your sexy song... More than all, your story of life and your attitude... and the way you love... And many more things i felt when I talked to you, even if it was only for a few times...</p>
                <p>I am not going to elaborate this now... </p>
                <p>I just want you to know that you mean the world to me and I will be more sad and worried and upset if something happens to you, even a small bruise... I dont want to lose you Margo...</p>
                <p>I want to be there for you as yours, love you and make you happy and live a beautiful life with you, but I cant promise anything about the future right now... Because I dont know until she says something... Im just held up by my word to her... </p>
                <p>Chianna has so many people backing her and taking care of her... Because of the stature that she is born with... But its not that girl I love... Its not her money or success or anything that Im into... I love the other side of her that she showed me every time we were together... Maybe she was pretending to be that... Meeting you makes me realise how similar you both are in many ways... And thats what I love... Its not the person as such... I gave my best of everything for her just like she ever wanted, needed and wished for...  and she did the same for me the time we were with each other everyday... So thats what we are... And thats why even in the midst of such an auspicious engagement, and such heap of money and success, she had a heart attack and still doesnt want to let me go... and so do I, even when she is in such bad health and knowing she is engaged, because she hasnt made it clear to me... So thats why we keep holding on to each other even when we are being tested this hard... She was stupid not to fight for me... That stupidness made this mess now...</p>
                <p>Margo... I just want you to know you are an amazing girl and I love you maybe even more than I love her... You are one of the two best girls of my life... You just lift me up just like that every single time and I would just love to be just falling onto you more and more being yours because it is beautiful, and I can do the same and more for you too... But, I cant do that as of now... </p>
                <p>Right now, I can't answer anything about us... Because I will never let down the one I love, and I will keep believing and fighting no matter what, until I get a clear answer... </p>
                <p>And you told me I dont know many things about how it is there... I dont know about that... I just trust everything that she told me... And even though she lied many things, I believe her love is true... Thats all I know for now... I will never let down of the one I love no matter what happens... </p>
                <p>Even if I keep struggling... Even when I feel stupid at times... Even when I have someone who I love just the same way or more, in front of me being ready to be mine... Even when I feel so disturbed of all the bad things each day, knowing I can be happy just by saying a yes now... I choose not to... </p>
                <p>Please know that this is a hard choice that Im making now by telling you to wait... For me, its not over until its over... And once Im in for someone, Im all in... Im  in for her from last September and I wont give up no matter how hard we are tested... So, its all on her right now... </p>
                <p>And that is why, I will not answer you now... </p>
                <p>But just know that my love and my word to her is the ONLY reason that stops me from being yours...</p>
                <p>I love you margo... You dont need to doubt that... I will not let you down if I give myself to you...</p>
                <p>But for now... I will wait... And I really hope you will too...</p>
                <p>I love you... </p>
